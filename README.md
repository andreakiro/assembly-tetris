# Tetris Game in Assembly

This is the main repository for the 2019 Computer Architecture EPFL course's project.

The goal of the project is to code a fully playable [Tetris Game](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) on FPGA machines in Assembly language.

## Nios II

The jar file provided in the repo is an editor and simulator for Assembler code.

### Setup

> alias nios="java -jar /Applications/NiosII.jar"

Adding like this line in your terminal bash/zsh profile enable to run the application anywhere with a single alias.

### Edition

Just open the tetris.asm file when you're in the NiosII app and edit the code!

### Simulation

You can easily assemble the code, and run a simulation to see evolution of registers, RAM/ROM and LEDs.
